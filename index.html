          finds you well and in good spirits! Where to begin? In the
          before-times when we could gather without giving it a second thought,
          life was simple. I mean, unapologetically threatening a key European
          ally by withholding critical funds until they agreed to release highly
          questionable "dirt" on a domestic political rival was considered "no
          biggie" by many, but at least a trip to the supermarket didn't require
          any real risk/benefit analysis. And so here we are.

          Remember your 16th birthday? What did you hope for? A car? Fancy new
          duds? A Super Nintendo? Such thoughts never crossed the mind of the
          newest driver in the Vanderveen household who requested a subscription
          to The New York Times (she already had access to The Washington Post).
          Not content to simply consume the news, Ann Marie has already begun
          cutting her teeth as an aspiring intrepid reporter. What do you do if
          you're too young to be hired by a media outlet to report the news?

          an internship with the Borgen Project (a non-profit organization
          addressing global poverty) tackling such issues as
